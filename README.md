## **Introduction**
This is an analysis of the Sales performance of AdventureWorksDW. It is done by analyzing data from different aspects of AdventureWorks DW's database. I analyzed data from dim_customers table, dim_date table, dim_product table, fact_InternetSales table, and Fact_SalesBudget table. 

This is a project that shows my ability to: 
- Query data from the database about sales of a fictitious bicycle manufacturer called Adventure Works DW from Jan 1st, 2021 to Jan 31st, 2023 on Microsoft SQL Server.
- ﻿﻿﻿Use Power BI to import, analyze and visualize sales overview, customer and product details.

Note: AdventureWorks DW is not a real company. Its database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.
## **Problem Statement**
The goal of this analysis is to: 
- Know the current sales performance and determine how it compares to past performance and company sales' growth rate. 
- Discover target markets, categories, products, and customers that have a large impact on sales success.
- Identify areas that can help to improve sale performance.
## **Skills and Concepts demonstrated**
- SQL
  - CASE Expression
  - JOIN Clause
  - LEFT, GETDATE, YEAR, CONCAT, ISNULL functions
  - ORDER BY command
  - Comparison operators

- Microsoft Power BI
  - Shaping data before the data analysis using Power Query Editor.
  - Data modeling
  - Performing DAX functions to calculate columns and measures in row and filter contexts for solving mathematical formulas.
  - Performing DAX's date and time intelligence functions and quick measures to create complex DAX code. 
  - Showing the information in the dashboard selectively with a Filter pane, Drill Down Hierarchies.
  - Data Visualization with proper charts.
## **Business Request & User Stories**

##  **Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)**
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis, the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.

## **Data Model**

Below is a screenshot of the data model after being sharped and transformed by Power Query.

This data model also shows how Fact_SalesBudget has been connected to Fact_InternetSales and other necessary Dim tables.

# **Analysis**
- There was a rise in sales in 2021 and 2022 and it increased significantly in 2022.
- The company didn’t achieve its goals in these two years, but the gap was bridged in 2022, compared to 2021 sales performance.

Accessories is the category ranking first in terms of total orders, but ranking second (3.15%) in terms of revenue; this might be due to the price gap among categories and the fact that several accessories can be used to fix a damaged bike.
- There was a rise in sales month by month and it reached a peak in the last month of the year.
- North America witnessed a rise in sales, surpassing Europe to become the top 1 area in terms of sales in 2022. This led to an increase in the total sales of the company in 2022.
